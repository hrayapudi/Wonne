DONE
===================================
1. Server side should repeat all validation done on client side
2. When performing server-side validation, how do we show errors?
3. When performing server-side validation, populate the fields that passed validation (don't force the user to fill them again)
4. Do we create 1 connection to DB or connection every time a Register/Login is called?
5. Work on forgot password page
6. Keep a copy of Table Schemas
7. Use annotations instead of servlet mappings in Web.xml
8. Add a Column called IsAdmin in DB, defaults to false.
9. Hide register link when user is logged in.


TODO:
==================================
1. What does the search button do on the main page?
2. What is a filter servlet and how is it used for Auth?
3. How will be show that user is logged in
4. Create a table to track login activity (Last logged in, times logged in etc)
5. Cancel button doesn't reset fields (after we have submitted the form)
6. If User is an admin, he can see link to admin page where he can:
	a) See all the registered users
	b) Make someone an admin
	c) Add/Remove users.
	
	

Should Do
